## 🏃‍♀️ AirAware-Routes 🌿

**AirAware-Routes** is a personal data project designed to help Barcelona’s running community discover cleaner, healthier routes by analyzing local air pollution patterns across space and time.

The goal is simple: run when and where the air is safest.

### ⏳ **Current Stage**
- Dataset: Hourly air pollution measurements from Barcelona monitoring stations (2025 data)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory analysis of PM2.5 and O₃ across districts, hours, and months
- Initial visualizations and temporal/spatial trends

#### 🚧 Next Steps (Planned)
- Implement a machine learning model to predict pollution levels for the next month
- Derive runner-focused insights such as:
  - Optimal running windows
  - Cleaner routes and districts

#### 💻 How to Run
- Clone the repository
- Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
- Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations
